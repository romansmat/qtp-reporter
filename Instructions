Assertions - Verifications
The following verification (assertion) functions are used:

verificationPassed (verificationMessage) - Use this function to assert a successful checkpoint. Provide a message to be tracked in the report file. Also triggers the micPass event of QTP.

verificationFailed (verificationMessage, screenShotName) - Use this function to assert a failed checkpoint. This function will take a screenshot of the active desktop at the time of failure. The screenshot will be accessible in the html report. Provide a message to be tracked in the report file and a name for the screenshot. Also triggers the micFail event of QTP.

verificationFailed_NoScreenShot (verificationMessage) - Use this function to assert a failed checkpoint. Provide a message to be tracked in the report file. No screenshot will be taken through this function. Also triggers the micFail event of QTP.

verificationInfo (verificationMessage) - Use this function to log information messages in the report file. Provide the message to be logged. Also triggers the micDone event of QTP.
